The WhatsApp lib

    Yowsup is no longer updated. There is no WhatsApp library available, but many people need it. I will gradually open source the library I have used for a long time. This library is written in Java. Will include all features except registration. Because the registration part is not in the scope of this open source.


# How to log in

 First of all, you need to have an account. This account can be exported from the mobile phone or simulator by using tools. What you export is a database file, which contains all the necessary information of the account. The phone and emulator must be root, otherwise they cannot be exported. The tools will be open source

 1) Use the emulator or mobile phone to register a WhatsApp account. The emulator and mobile phone need to have root permission.

 2) After successful registration, install the extraction tool (APK) to extract account information. The extraction tool is open source and can be modified by yourself.

 3) Log in with the extracted account information.

# Step
  1) Waiting to submit login part of the source code.  (done)
  2) Send text message
